Creating this to host my first official programming class' work. Done at CUNY Baruch College at CIS 3100. Lots of fun things to look back on when I become a more experienced programmer. Lots of .cpp files from various assignments during my Fall 2012 semester, though not as in depth as a real computer science major.
